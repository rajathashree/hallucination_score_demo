# hallucination_score_demo
This is a simple demo project built with Django. It’s designed to test how people interact with large language model (LLM) answers and whether showing a hallucination score changes how much they trust the response.

Features: 
1. A chat-style survey UI (looks like you’re talking to an AI)

2. Two modes: with hallucination scores or without

3. Options to either accept the AI’s answer or look it up

4. A simple scoring system to track decisions

5. Results stored for later analysis
